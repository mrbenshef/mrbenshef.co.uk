[Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/rules) is a bi-annual event where you create a game _from scratch_ in 48 hours. That includes the code, art, sound - everything!

The theme for ludum dare 46 was "keep it alive". Inspired by the ongoing pandemic I created a game about protecting a cell. You play as a nanobot tasked with defending the nucleus from the virus.

## How to play

You start with 25 seconds to prepare before the next wave. Fly around the edge of the cell to find where the viruses are planning to mount their attack. After the preparation timer is up, blast the hostile DNA they release.

Destroying the hostile DNA will drop protein points (PP). Once you have collected all the protein points head back to the nucleus and press E to interact. The nucleus allows you to purchase turrets with PP. Surrounding the nucleus are 3 mitochondria which offer powerful upgrades for PP.

Hopefully you are ready for the next round, because the virus is returning, and it wonâ€™t be so easily defeated this time!

## Controls

- W - fly up
- S - fly down
- A - fly left
- D - fly right
- E - interact
- Left click - Shoot
